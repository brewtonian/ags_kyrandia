# ags_kyrandia
This AGS interface template combines my favourite interface features from the BASS template and The Legend of Kyrandia.

Initially based on the BASS template by Ghost and the AGS team. Features a heavily modified TwoClickHandler script.

Intended to serve as a template with the full functionality of the interface used in The Legend of Kyrandia by Westwood Studios.

NOTE:
The compiled version uses assets from the Legend of Kyrandia for demonstration purposes ONLY.
These assets have been removed from the template.
