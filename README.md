# ags_kyrandia

This AGS interface template combines my favourite interface features from the BASS template and The Legend of Kyrandia.
Initially based on the BASS template by Ghost and the AGS team. Features a heavily modified TwoClickHandler script.
Intended to serve as a template with the full functionality of the interface used in The Legend of Kyrandia by Westwood Studios.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY NOTE

The compiled version uses assets from the Legend of Kyrandia for demonstration purposes ONLY.
These assets have been removed from the template.
Sorry for the uggo asset replacements.

The scripts in this project are released under the MIT license.

FEATURES
- Single click on inventory items to pick up or pop out of slots.
- Single click on screen to drop items in a room.
- Retains useful right-click and left-click handling from BASS template.
- Custom room text in the status until timeout.
- Kyrandia style - Player can carry items between rooms without having to slot them in inventory.
- Kyrandia 2 style inventory scrolling (non-looping)
- Custom cursors for displaying room exits on mouseover.
- Dummy item generation.
